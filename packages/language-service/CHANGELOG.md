## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Domain-value input decode, timestamp collision handling, and adaptive generation.

  **Fixes [#19](https://github.com/jmenga/effect-dynamodb/issues/19)** — `Entity.put/create/update/upsert` (and `Transaction`/`Batch` put paths) now correctly decode domain values. Previously, TypeScript said "pass me a `DateTime.Utc`" but the runtime decoded via a transform schema that expected an ISO string — callers who followed the TS contract hit a `ValidationError`. The runtime decode now uses `fromSelf` variants for date-annotated fields, matching the TS contract.

  **New: declare system-field-colliding timestamps in your model.** If your domain model declares `createdAt` / `updatedAt` with a date-compatible schema (e.g. `Schema.DateTimeUtcFromString`, `Schema.DateFromString`, `Schema.DateTimeUtc`), and `timestamps: true` is set:

  - The input type marks the colliding fields as optional — caller may omit them (library auto-generates) or supply their own value (user value wins, useful for imports/backfill).
  - The library-generated timestamp respects the model field's storage encoding, so declaring `createdAt: Schema.DateTimeUtcFromString.pipe(DynamoModel.storedAs(DynamoModel.DateEpochSeconds))` yields epoch-seconds storage even though the library is generating the value.
  - `createdAt` is treated as immutable in the update schema (stripped entirely).

  **New: user-owned non-date fields that collide with a system field name.** If your model declares e.g. `createdAt: Schema.String` (as a user-managed composite value, not a timestamp), the library detects the non-date collision and yields the field to the user — library timestamp management applies only to non-colliding fields (e.g. `updatedAt`). Preserves existing patterns that use `createdAt` as a plain string SK composite.

  **Errors:**

  - `EDD-9021` — the `version` field cannot be declared in the model alongside `versioned: true`, because optimistic locking requires library-managed increment.

  **Type ergonomics.** The exposed `inputSchema` / `createSchema` / `updateSchema` codec types (and the corresponding `Entity.put` / `create` / `update` call signatures) now flatten into plain object literals in hover tooltips instead of showing as wrapped generic aliases.

### Minor Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/jmenga/effect-dynamodb/pull/4) [`76654b7`](https://github.com/jmenga/effect-dynamodb/commit/76654b7a6d35a361fe74a2733bdfb1ce837504bf) Thanks [@jmenga](https://github.com/jmenga)! - Add `.primary()` query accessor on the bound client

  Every entity now exposes a `.primary(...)` accessor on `db.entities.*` alongside the existing GSI accessors. The primary index is treated symmetrically with GSIs: pass required PK composites (and optionally one or more SK composites) to get back a `BoundQuery` with the full combinator surface (`.where()`, `.filter()`, `.select()`, `.limit()`, `.reverse()`, `.startFrom()`, `.consistentRead()`, `.collect()`, `.fetch()`, `.paginate()`, `.count()`).

  Previously the primary index was deliberately excluded from accessor generation, so the shared-PK join-table pattern (many items under one partition key, distinguished by SK) had no first-class typed query path — only `.get(fullKey)` or a raw `Query.make` escape hatch.

  ```ts
  // List every membership in an organization — PK only, SK composites omitted
  const allMembers =
    yield *
    db.entities.Memberships.primary({
      orgId: "org-acme",
    }).collect();

  // Narrow by partial SK composite (begins_with prefix match)
  const bobs =
    yield *
    db.entities.Memberships.primary({
      orgId: "org-acme",
      userId: "u-bob",
    }).collect();
  ```

  `.get(fullKey)` remains the dedicated `GetItem` path for single-item strongly-consistent reads. Resolves [#2](https://github.com/jmenga/effect-dynamodb/issues/2).
